<h1>Sh1n0e's Blog</h1>

<p> Welcome to my blog! I plan to use this as a way to keep any REALLY interesting evens that might happen as I go on through my journey to learning CyberSecurity. This may also be a space to store anything about me that is relevant for now and towards the future as well.
</p>

<p>For now while I am still learning I do have a repo on github dedicated to the start of my journey currently right here:</p>
