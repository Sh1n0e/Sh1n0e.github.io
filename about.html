<h1>About</h1>

<p>I am currently a student at Carleton University in my 3rd year majoring with a Bachelors of Information Technology (BIT) in the networking stream. Funnily enough it was one specific class in this program that got me into making this website and develop skills for CTF in terms of network security in conjunction with my experience working on projects within Algonquin College's student run club named "Kali Club".</p>

<p>In particular I am finding that so far in my learning journey I have a higher affinity for the web exploitation aspect of network security.</p>
